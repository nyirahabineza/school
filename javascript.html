    <p>Shapes are part of our daily life and it is important to understand each and every shape. The most common shape we see around is the triangle. The shape with three corners are commonly known as the triangle but every three-cornered shape is not the same, and to understand this concept we are here to explain you with different types of triangles.</p>

        <p>Triangle is a three-sided polygon. This closed figure consists of three lines which are linked at the endpoint to each other. The main properties of the triangle are that the sum of the interior angle of the triangle will be 180° and the sum of the exterior angles will be 360° always. Triangle can be classified according to their sides and interior angles. Following are the details about each qualification.</p>

<p>The triangle with only two equal sides is known as the isosceles triangle. Not only two equal sides, the isosceles triangle also consists of two equal angles. The following figure is of the isosceles triangle-

<p>The triangle with no equal sides is the scalene triangle. Each line of this triangle is of different length. Following is the figure of the scalene triangle:</p>
